Time Series Stock APIs

This suite of APIs provide global equity data in 4 different temporal
resolutions: (1) daily, (2) weekly, (3) monthly, and (4) intraday. Daily, weekly,
 and monthly time series contain 20+ years of historical data.


TIME_SERIES_INTRADAY High Usage

This API returns intraday time series of the equity specified, covering extended
trading hours where applicable (e.g., 4:00am to 8:00pm Eastern Time for the US
market). The intraday data is computed directly from the Securities Information
Processor (SIP) market-aggregated data feed. You can query both raw (as-traded)
and split/dividend-adjusted intraday data from this endpoint.

This API returns the most recent 1-2 months of intraday data and is best suited
for short-term/medium-term charting and trading strategy development. If you are
targeting a deeper intraday history, please use the Extended Intraday API.

Intraday (Extended History)

This API returns historical intraday time series for the trailing 2 years, covering over 2 million data points per ticker. The intraday data is computed directly from the Securities Information Processor (SIP) market-aggregated data feed. You can query both raw (as-traded) and split/dividend-adjusted intraday data from this endpoint. Common use cases for this API include data visualization, trading simulation/backtesting, and machine learning and deep learning applications with a longer horizon.

❚ Required: slice

Two years of minute-level intraday data contains over 2 million data points, which can take up to Gigabytes of memory. To ensure optimal API response speed, the trailing 2 years of intraday data is evenly divided into 24 "slices" - year1month1, year1month2, year1month3, ..., year1month11, year1month12, year2month1, year2month2, year2month3, ..., year2month11, year2month12. Each slice is a 30-day window, with year1month1 being the most recent and year2month12 being the farthest from today. By default, slice=year1month1.

❚ Optional: adjusted

By default, adjusted=true and the output time series is adjusted by historical split and dividend events. Set adjusted=false to query raw (as-traded) intraday values.
